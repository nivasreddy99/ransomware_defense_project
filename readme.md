## Project Overview

This project focuses on the detection and mitigation of ransomware attacks within a controlled environment. The aim is to monitor file system activities, detect suspicious behaviors indicative of ransomware, and implement mitigation strategies to protect critical data.

**Disclaimer:** This project is for educational purposes only. All activities are conducted within an isolated virtual machine (VM) to ensure safety and prevent any unintended consequences.

---

## Features

- **File Encryption/Decryption Module:** Encrypts and decrypts files in a designated directory using symmetric encryption.
- **File System Monitoring:** Monitors specified directories for file changes in real-time.
- **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Detects potential ransomware activity based on file modification patterns.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Implements automated responses such as process termination and file quarantine.
- **Logging and Alerting:** Logs all activities and sends alerts when suspicious behavior is detected.
- **Configurable Settings:** Allows customization of monitoring parameters and thresholds via a configuration file.

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher / Linux / macOS
- **Python Version:** Python 3.7 or higher
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `cryptography`
  - `watchdog`
  - `psutil`

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ransomware_defense_project.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ransomware_defense_project
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Required Python Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create Necessary Directories:

bash
Copy code
mkdir critical logs quarantine
Populate the Critical Directory:

Place the project description file into critical/.
Create subdirectories lab1/, lab2/, lab3/ inside critical/.
Place respective lab manuals or dummy files into these subdirectories.
Usage
Configure Settings:

Edit the config.ini file to adjust monitoring parameters, directories, and thresholds as needed.
Run the Main Application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Monitoring:

The application will start monitoring the critical/ directory for file system events.
Detection and Mitigation:

If suspicious activity is detected, the system will log the event, send an alert, and initiate mitigation strategies as configured.
Logs and Alerts:

Check the logs/ directory for detailed logs.
Alerts will be printed to the console or can be configured to send email notifications.
Configuration
The config.ini file allows you to customize the application's behavior.

Example Configuration:
ini
Copy code
[Directories]
CriticalDir = ./critical
QuarantineDir = ./quarantine

[Encryption]
KeyFile = encryption_key.key

[Detection]
EventWindowSize = 100
EventThreshold = 50
TimeWindowSeconds = 60

[Mitigation]
QuarantineDir = ./quarantine
CriticalDir: Directory to monitor for ransomware activity.
QuarantineDir: Directory where suspicious files will be moved.
KeyFile: File where the encryption key is stored.
EventWindowSize: Number of recent events to consider in detection.
EventThreshold: Threshold of events that triggers detection.
TimeWindowSeconds: Time window for considering events in detection.
Testing
Unit Tests:

Run unit tests to verify each component:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover tests
Simulating Ransomware Activity:

Manually modify multiple files in the critical/ directory to simulate suspicious activity.
Observe if the detection engine triggers an alert and initiates mitigation.
Monitoring Logs:

Check the logs/ directory for log files detailing the application's operations and any detected anomalies.
Limitations and Future Work
Current Detection Mechanism:

Based on simple thresholds and may not detect advanced ransomware.
May produce false positives under heavy legitimate file operations.
Future Enhancements:

Implement machine learning algorithms for more sophisticated detection.
Add network monitoring to detect ransomware communicating with command and control servers.
Develop a user interface for easier configuration and monitoring.
