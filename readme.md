## Project Overview

This project focuses on the detection and mitigation of ransomware attacks within a controlled environment. The aim is to monitor file system activities, detect suspicious behaviors indicative of ransomware, and implement mitigation strategies to protect critical data.

**Disclaimer:** This project is for educational purposes only. All activities are conducted within an isolated virtual machine (VM) to ensure safety and prevent any unintended consequences.

## Features

- **File Encryption/Decryption Module:** Encrypts and decrypts files in a designated directory using symmetric encryption.
- **File System Monitoring:** Monitors specified directories for file changes in real-time.
- **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Detects potential ransomware activity based on file modification patterns.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Implements automated responses such as process termination and file quarantine.
- **Logging and Alerting:** Logs all activities and sends alerts when suspicious behavior is detected.
- **Configurable Settings:** Allows customization of monitoring parameters and thresholds via a configuration file.
